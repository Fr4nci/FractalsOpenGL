# Fractals using OpenGL

A fractal explorer built using OpenGL and Python. Only Mandelbrot and BurningShip fractals are only implemented and it's avaible only a black-and-white shader: I'll look forward to implement a more colored shader in the future and the Julia set. 
The idea for the project is purely educational: I'm studying OpenGL and I have decided to re-adapt my work done for generating fractals using this library and not matplotlib.
